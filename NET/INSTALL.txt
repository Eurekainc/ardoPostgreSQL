Install instructions for .NET:

1) Stop all OutSystems services (including IIS)
2) Copy dlls to C:\Program Files\OutSystems\Platform Server\plugins\database
3) Make sure to open properties and Unblock the DLLs if they are blocked
4) Restart all OutSystems Services
5) Run Configuration Tool and install Service Center
6) If you have any application that uses the connector, publish it again.

After this you'll get an extra value for PostgreSQL in the Databases dropdown when adding a new Database Connection.
